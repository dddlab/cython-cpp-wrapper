Description: gconcord is an R package that help estimate a sparse 
  inverse covariance matrix for high dimensional data using graphical CONCORD method. 
  It enables users to obtain a sparse graphical model for high-dimensional data using 
  either a L1 penalty or an elastic net penalty. The flexibility and simplicity of 
  the package facilitate users to apply graphical CONCORD easily.
